<h2 class="u-margintop0">Privacy notice</h2>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) replaces the Data Protection Regulation (Directive 95/46/EC) from 25 May 2018. The Regulation aims to harmonise data protection legislation across EU member states, enhancing privacy rights for individuals and providing a strict framework within which commercial organisations can legally operate. Even though the UK has expressed its intention to leave the EU in March 2019, the GDPR will be applicable in the UK from 25th May 2018.</p>

<p>Your new rights under the GDPR are set out in this notice but will only apply once the GDPR becomes law on 25th May 2018.</p>

<p>2. Compliance with legal obligations (regulatory and statutory obligations):<br />
