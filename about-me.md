Originally from Belgium, Dr Spiegel completed a five year degree course at Glasgow University School of Veterinary Medicine.

Tamir has gained his National French Certificate in Ophthalmology in 2011.

From 2004 Dr Spiegel has taken a keen interest in ophthalmology. During his time in Manchester Tamir worked in a large referral hospital where he honed his skills in Veterinary Ophthalmology. Dr Spiegel gained vast amount of experience both clinically and medically which has allowed him to start his own referral service Vision Vet.

Vision Vet has been providing eye care to small animals in veterinary surgeries throughout the UK since 2009. Dr Spiegel is now focussed on providing gold standard ophthalmological care throughout Scotland.

Dr Spiegel is very proud to manage his own ophthalmic cases and do so in a thorough manner; however he is a great believer in resolving cases as fast as possible in the least invasive way.
