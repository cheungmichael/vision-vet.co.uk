    <p>Vision Vet is happy to announce the launch of a comprehensive 12-month ophthalmology CPD Webinars where Dr Tamir Spiegel will cover common ophthalmic conditions in small animal practice.</p>

    <p>Many Veterinary surgeons approach me to express that ophthalmology is one area that they feel uncomfortable to manage in first opinion practice, therefore I constructed a course which will improve your knowledge, skills and confidence in ophthalmology, and you would be able to use the materials as a reference when treating ophthalmic cases.</p>

    <p>Every month I'll be discussing 2-3 ophthalmology topics. You will have an access to the course and itâ€™s notes anytime and there will be Q&A option about each topic.</p>

    <p>The webinar can be used towards your CPD allowance which will give you 30 hours.</p>

    <p>The course will start on 1st August 2019.</p>

    <h2>Fees</h2>

    <p>Cost for 12-month comprehensive CPD webinar:</p>

    <p>Early bird by 1st June: &pound;895+VAT</p>

    <p>After 1st June: &pound;995+VAT</p>

    <p>Pick an ophthalmology topic: &pound;60+VAT per topic.</p>

    <p>In case the course is booked by more than one vet from the same practice each vet gets 20% off the full price.</p>

    <p>You can also get &pound;50 off in case you recommend the course to a vet who books it.</p>
